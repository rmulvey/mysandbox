/**
 * Customers are billed based on their subscription tier for each user who was
 * active during a given day. You had a chat with some other engineers on the
 * team and decided that the following algorithm would work:
 * 
 * Requirements: 1. Calculate a daily rate for the active subscription tier 2.
 * For each day of the month, identify which users were active that day 3.
 * Multiply the number of active users for the day by the daily rate 4. Return
 * the running total at the end (because we're calculating money, round the
 * final amount back to 2 decimal places)
 * 
 * 
 * Note: Here is a link to a document I created that has the exact "assignment"
 * that caused this to be created:
 * https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XTmqs6AwmKXB_gY292ppfg1d5uD6zjxmOYf0H2q0vDc/edit
